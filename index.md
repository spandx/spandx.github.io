## Spandx ![badge](https://github.com/mokhan/spandx/workflows/ci/badge.svg)

Spanx is a ruby API for interacting with the https://spdx.org software license catalogue. This gem includes a command line interface to scan a software project for the software licenses that are associated with each dependency in the project. It also allows you to hook additional information for each dependency. For instance, you can  spandx leverages an offline cache of software licenses for known dependencies. The offline cache allows spandx to perform a truly airgap friendly scan of software projects.

### Supported language package managers

Spandx can work with following language's package managers. It utilises lock files generated by package managers to find dependencies.

| Language  | Package Manager    | Tested in   |
| ------------ | --------------- | -------:    |
| Ruby         | bundler         | 1.17.3      |
| Js           | Npm             | 6.13.4      |
| Js           | Yarn            | 1.19.1      |
| Python       | Pypi(pipenv)    | v2018.11.26 |
| C#           | nuget           | <>          |
| Java         | Maven           | 3.6.3       |
| Php          | Composer        | 1.10.5      |


### How to install it

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spandx'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install spandx
    
### How to use as command line tool

The command line interface supports operations to build and fetch the latest offline index.
See the help for each subcommand for more information on how to use the command.

```bash
モ spandx
Commands:
  spandx help [COMMAND]      # Describe available commands or one specific command
  spandx scan LOCKFILE       # Scan a lockfile and list dependencies/licenses
  spandx version             # spandx version
```

To scan a specific project file use the `scan` command:

```bash
モ spandx scan dotnet/application.sln
モ spandx scan java/pom.xml
モ spandx scan python/Pipfile.lock
モ spandx scan ruby/Gemfile.lock
```

To activate airgap mode use the `--airgap` option:

```bash
モ spandx scan dotnet/application.sln --airgap
モ spandx scan ruby/Gemfile.lock --airgap
```

### How can use Spanx as Ruby API

To fetch the latest version of the catalogue data from [SPDX](https://spdx.org/licenses/licenses.json).

```ruby
catalogue = Spandx::Spdx::Catalogue.latest
catalogue.each do |license|
  puts license.inspect
end
```

To load an offline copy of the data.

```ruby
path = File.join(Dir.pwd, 'licenses.json')
catalogue = Spandx::Spdx::Catalogue.from_file(path)
catalogue.each do |license|
  puts license.inspect
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/cibuild` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
